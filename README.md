> Anxiety is sort of the opposite of ego. You're so sure you'll do everything wrong you're afraid to do anything at all. It results from over-motivation- leading to errors that lead to an underestimation of one's self.

## Personal mission statement (Why I’m here at One Stop):
To build a fair and humane work environment that allows folks at Onestop to express their fullest capability and potential. To identify and remove impediments for my teams.

I have been poking at computers for a very long time. Over the last decade my focus has been on org and people development within companies for whom technology is not their core business. It’s my goal to help Onestop codify the Lean maker/disrupter ethos in our internal practices and to share our how with the world.

## Core job responsibilities & Objectives
Grow Onestop’s technology capability by developing a team of agile (and amazing) developers, designers, analysts, and technical staff. Software development and design are an integrated part of everything we do at Onestop aI want our folks to fit naturally into cross functional teams. Ensure that Engineering and Design do not become functional silos or service organizations.
