* Raises the bar cross-functionally (managers/ICs/Leads/QA/Scrum Masters/etc.) through mentorship, continuous-learning opportunities, and performance-improvement plans.
* Strategically positions engineering for business value-add while relationship-building with key stakeholders across the company.
